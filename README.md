# Home-data-exploit
Collect data from home directory and send them to target email 

# Use with caution

1. Script lists all folders and files from home then it searches for another folders inside home and lists all folders and files inside that folders and stores everything inside data array.

at the end, data is being sent to the target email

at the bottom of script, you have 2 options ( uncomment one you want )
first one is destroying python script at the end so no source code left

another is to create bat file in system startup programs, so everytime you boot PC, script will run again
